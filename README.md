# Hi! I'm Mark Battistella

I'm a video editor, cutting and coding through life

</div>

### About me

I'm from Melbourne, Australia ðŸ¦˜.

I am a video editor with skills using Avid (ACSR Elite) and Adobe.

Recently I've been dabbling more intently into coding, mainly Swift and SwiftUI. But I previously made Wordpress websites, and custom modules using PHP. I'm also pretty fluent in HTML and CSS.

:zap: **Fun fact:** I also try to do astrophotography

### Showcase items

### What I've worked on

Most of the things I work on are for the company I work at, and can't be detailed externally.

But some of the personal things I've made are:

### "Books"

I have a couple of "books" in the Apple Book Store, which really aren't books but it was a great learning experience on how to properly publish items.

- [**Sony NXCAM FS100 Picture Profile Styles**](https://books.apple.com/us/book/sony-nxcam-fs100-picture-profile-styles/id1028776054)<br>A preset book for the Sony NXCam FS100 camera
