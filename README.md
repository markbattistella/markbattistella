I'm from Melbourne, Australia ðŸ¦˜.

I am a video editor by definition, but I've always liked to learn.

I dabble with the web world (`HTML`, `CSS`, `PHP`) - but I think I enjoy Wordpress the most, or at least creating things beyond just a "blog".

I'm in the process of learning Swift (and âœ¨ SwiftUI âœ¨)!

I've worked on some pretty awesome projects, but mostly closed door which sucks ðŸ˜­!

I've had two "books" out: [Sony NXCAM FS100 Picture Profile Styles](https://books.apple.com/us/book/sony-nxcam-fs100-picture-profile-styles/id1028776054) (which is just a preset book for the camera) and [To The Ones That Got Away](https://books.apple.com/us/book/to-the-ones-that-got-away/id1028779304) (which is a collection of images showing you can take decent images without spending a lot on expensive equipment).
